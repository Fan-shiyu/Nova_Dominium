# Nova_Dominium

NOVA DOMINIUM is a digital Domain Name Ownership Checker that aims to automate the manual lookup process of domain names, which are a core corporate asset that become especially relevant in the context of Mergers and Acquisition. It pulls accurate ownership data from multiple authoritative sources and converts the raw data into legal insight. Thereby it frees lawyers to focus on analysis, reduces human error and improves the quality and speed of due diligence.

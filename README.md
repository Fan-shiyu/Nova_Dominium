# Nova Dominium  
**Domain Due-Diligence & Ownership Intelligence**

Nova Dominium automates the collection and analysis of domain information to help legal, compliance, and security teams quickly identify ownership issues and domain-related risks. Users can upload domain lists, run automated checks, review enriched data, and download structured reports in minutes.

## Key Features

### Multi-Format File Upload
Supports:
- CSV  
- Excel (.xlsx)  
- Text (.txt)

It automatically extracts domain names and prepares them for analysis.

### Automated Intelligence Pipeline
For each domain, the system fetches and enriches data from:
- WHOIS  
- RDAP  
- DNS-over-HTTPS  
- HTTP response and redirect behavior  
- TLS / Certificate Transparency logs  
- Optional threat intelligence APIs

### Risk Evaluation Engine
Each domain is assessed based on:
- Ownership clarity  
- Domain expiry horizon  
- DNS health  
- HTTP reachability  
- TLS certificate details  
- Threat indicators

Outputs include:
- Risk Flag (Green / Amber / Red)  
- Risk Types (detailed indicators explaining the cause)

### Structured Results Table
Each processed domain includes:
- Ownership and registrar information  
- Nameservers  
- Technical signals  
- Data source breakdown  
- Timestamp  
- Link to a PDF evidence report

### Evidence Reports
The tool generates a standardized PDF for each domain, containing:
- Summary and ownership details  
- Risk explanation  
- WHOIS/RDAP data  
- DNS / HTTP / TLS diagnostics  
- Raw technical data (when available)

These reports can be used for legal files, compliance audits, and documentation.

### Excel Export
The full results set can be downloaded as a clean, formatted Excel (.xlsx) file.
